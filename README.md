This is a single-page music discography app in the style of Bandcamp. I made it using Node.js, Express, Backbone, jQuery, Handlebars, Jade and Stylus.

The albums are all made up of original chiptunes and acid trax that I produced over the last few years for fun. The mp3 files are being hosted on archive.org.
